# 🍺 BrewTracker

A comprehensive brewing management application that helps homebrewers create, manage, and track their beer recipes and brewing sessions.

## 🌟 About the Application

BrewTracker is a full-stack web application that enables homebrewers to:

- Create and manage beer recipes with detailed ingredients and metrics
- Calculate important brewing metrics (OG, FG, ABV, IBU, SRM)
- Track brewing sessions and fermentation progress
- Analyze yeast performance with real-world attenuation data
- Browse and share recipes with advanced search and filtering
- Get AI-powered recipe suggestions for style compliance and optimization
- Share recipes publicly with proper attribution and access control
- View recipe statistics and brewing history

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This repository contains two applications:

- 🖥️ A frontend React App - User interface for recipe management
- 🔌 A backend Flask API - Python-based server handling recipe calculations and data storage

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 📥 Install Dependencies

1. Install Node.js using NVM:

```bash
brew install nvm
nvm install 22
```

2. Install Python 3.13:

```bash
brew install python@3.13
```

3. Install MongoDB:

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@7.0
```

### 🛠️ Set up your project

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

brew services start mongodb-community
```

### ⚙️ Environment Setup

#### Frontend

Create `frontend/.env`:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
```

#### Backend

Create `backend/.env`:

```plaintext

#### 3. Features

- **Sign In with Google**: Users can authenticate using their Google account
- **Sign Up with Google**: New users can create accounts instantly
- **Account Linking**: Existing users can link their Google account to their local account
- **Secure Authentication**: Server-side token verification with Google's API
- **JWT Integration**: Google authentication integrates seamlessly with existing JWT tokens
- **FedCM Compatibility**: Modern Google Sign-In implementation using Federated Credential Management (FedCM) APIs

### 📦 Database Setup

No explicit database setup commands are needed for MongoDB.
When you first start the application:

1. MongoDB will automatically create the database and collections as needed
2. The application will check if ingredient data exists
3. If no ingredients are found, it will automatically seed the database with initial ingredient data from `backend/data/brewtracker.ingredients.json` using `backend/seeds/seed_ingredients.py`
4. Similarly, beer style guides will be seeded from `backend/data/beer_style_guides.json` using `backend/seeds/seed_beer_styles.py`
5. System users (Anonymous User, BrewTracker System, Community) will be seeded from `backend/data/system_users.json` using `backend/seeds/seed_system_users.py` to support account deletion and community features

To manually verify your MongoDB setup:

```bash
# Start the MongoDB shell
mongosh

# Switch to your database
use brewtracker

# Verify collections
show collections
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
flask run
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## 🤖 AI Recipe Analysis Engine

BrewTracker features a sophisticated AI-powered recipe analysis engine that provides intelligent brewing suggestions and optimization recommendations. The engine uses a flowchart-based approach to systematically analyze recipes and provide actionable improvements.

### Flowchart-Based Analysis System

![AI Recipe Analysis Flowchart](AI_flowchart.png)

_The comprehensive AI recipe analysis flowchart showing decision trees for IBU optimization, ABV/FG adjustments, SRM color balancing, OG targeting, and ingredient normalization._

The AI engine follows a structured workflow that:

1. **Analyzes Recipe Composition**: Evaluates ingredient ratios, base malt percentages, and overall recipe structure
2. **Checks Style Compliance**: Compares recipes against BJCP style guidelines for accuracy and authenticity
3. **Identifies Optimization Opportunities**: Detects areas for improvement in grain bills, hop schedules, and yeast selection
4. **Generates Intelligent Suggestions**: Provides specific, actionable recommendations with predicted impacts
5. **Validates Improvements**: Ensures suggestions maintain recipe integrity and brewing feasibility

### Key AI Features

- **Smart Base Malt Selection**: Style-aware malt recommendations (e.g., Pilsner for German lagers, 2-Row for American IPAs)
- **Comprehensive Style Compliance**: Multi-metric optimization targeting OG, FG, ABV, IBU, and SRM ranges
- **Automatic Color Adjustment**: Intelligent addition of color malts like Blackprinz when SRM is below style minimum
- **Hop Timing Optimization**: IBU-focused timing adjustments with conservative brewing practices
- **Ingredient Normalization**: Rounds ingredients to brewing-friendly increments (25g/0.5oz steps)
- **Cascading Effects Prediction**: Accurately predicts how changes affect all recipe metrics

### Technical Implementation

The AI system is built using:

- **Flowchart Engine**: Configurable YAML-based workflow execution (`backend/services/ai/flowchart_engine.py`)
- **Optimization Strategies**: Modular brewing science algorithms (`backend/services/ai/optimization_strategies.py`)
- **Recipe Context Management**: Stateful recipe analysis with condition evaluation (`backend/services/ai/recipe_context.py`)
- **BJCP Integration**: Complete beer style guide integration for accurate style matching
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant metric updates using brewing calculation engine

### Quality Control

The system includes stringent quality checks:

- ✅ **Full Compliance Validation**: Only shows "Recipe Analysis Complete" when ALL style metrics are within BJCP ranges
- 🔍 **Manual Review Indicators**: Alerts when improvements are needed but can't be auto-generated
- ⚖️ **Base Malt Requirements**: Ensures base malts constitute ≥55% of grain bill
- 🎯 **Conservative Adjustments**: Prefers safe, proven brewing techniques over aggressive changes

## 🔐 System Users Architecture

BrewTracker implements a sophisticated system users architecture to handle account deletion while preserving community contributions. This ensures that when users delete their accounts, valuable public recipes remain accessible to the brewing community.

### System User Types

- **Anonymous User** (`anonymous@brewtracker.system`): Receives public recipes from deleted accounts to maintain community access while protecting user privacy
- **BrewTracker System** (`system@brewtracker.system`): Handles automated processes, system-generated content, and administrative functions
- **Community** (`community@brewtracker.system`): Represents community-contributed recipes, shared templates, and collaborative brewing content

### Account Deletion Features

- **Data Preservation Choice**: Users can choose to preserve public recipes for the community or delete everything
- **Secure Deletion Process**: Multi-step confirmation with password verification and "DELETE" confirmation
- **Attribution Transfer**: Public recipes are transparently transferred to "Anonymous User" with proper attribution
- **Complete Privacy**: All private data, personal recipes, and brew sessions are permanently deleted
- **System Protection**: System users cannot be deleted, ensuring platform integrity

### Technical Implementation

- **Automatic Seeding**: System users are automatically created from `backend/data/system_users.json` on first run
- **Service Integration**: `UserDeletionService` handles comprehensive account deletion with data preservation options
- **Database Integrity**: Validates system user existence before allowing account deletions
- **Audit Logging**: All deletion operations are logged for security and compliance purposes
